# hello-world
my first github experience
I have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and after 15 years of working in various industries have decided to become a software engineer :)
Wish me luck!!!!!!!!!
I have done a PG course in Blockchain technology and enroute got equipped with HTML, CSS, java, javascript
Need to brush up on the above and also add architectural skills to become a DApp developer
adding this line to see if my local repository (:D\git ) finds out if modified
